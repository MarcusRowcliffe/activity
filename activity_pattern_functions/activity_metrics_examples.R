#	4. Functions require the following information. 
#		ClockTime: time of the event as recorded by local time (15:30 becomes 15.5)
#		day: day of the month at which the event ocurred
#		month: number of the month of the year at which the event ocurred
#		lat: latitude in degrees, positive (north) and negative (south) of the 
#		equator
#		long: longitude in degrees, positive (west), and negative (east) of the
#	 	equator
#		timeZone
